# Blockchain-Based Chat Application

Welcome to the **Blockchain-Based Chat Application** repository! This project is a decentralized, secure, and efficient chat application leveraging blockchain technology to ensure privacy, transparency, and immutability of messages.

## 🛠 Features

- **Decentralized Messaging**: Messages are stored on a blockchain, eliminating the need for a central server.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures that only the intended recipient can read the messages.
- **Immutable Records**: All messages are stored as transactions on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.
- **User Authentication**: Uses blockchain wallets for unique user identification and login.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across web and mobile platforms.
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple users and large conversations without compromising performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Blockchain Node**: Set up a blockchain node (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger) or use a blockchain service.
- **Wallet**: Use a cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for user authentication and transactions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-chatapp.git
   cd blockchain-chatapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add blockchain node connection details, wallet addresses, and other configuration settings.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 📝 How It Works

1. **User Registration**: Users connect their blockchain wallet to the app, creating a unique identity.
2. **Sending Messages**: Messages are encrypted and stored as transactions on the blockchain.
3. **Retrieving Messages**: The application fetches messages from the blockchain and decrypts them for the recipient.
